# social-media-website

Using PHP, Html, CSS and MySQL I created a website with sign-up and login functionality for users. When a user signs up they are put into a database that will save 
their login information.

Once logged in, users have access to pages that were not visibile before logging in, using the SESSION method that comes with PHP.

Also created a leaderboard that keeps track of who has highest amount of clicks on the entire website. Everytime it is clicked the currently logged in user's 
"click score" will automatically be updated in the database and this will be shown in the leaderboard.
